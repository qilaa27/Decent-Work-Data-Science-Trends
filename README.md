# Decent Work in the Digital Era: Data Science Trends

This repository contains the final project for the course assignment **Case Study related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 8 ‚Äì Decent Work and Economic Growth)**.  
Our team analyzed the **[Data Science Salaries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/data-science-salary-2021-to-2023)** from Kaggle to explore global employment trends and salary distributions in the Data Science field from 2020‚Äì2024.

## üéØ Objective
To provide insights into the growth of Data Science careers worldwide and how they support **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** by:
- Identifying the most in-demand job roles and their salary ranges.
- Exploring salary trends across countries and years.
- Examining work models (Remote, On-site, Hybrid) by company size.
- Understanding employment types across experience levels.

## üìä Dataset
- **Total records:** ~6,600
- **Variables:** 11 columns including job_title, experience_level, employment_type, work_models, work_year, employee_residence, salary_in_usd, company_location, and company_size.
- **Source:** Kaggle & Trading Economics (for unemployment references).

## üß© Methods
- Data cleaning: checked missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **R** with `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `plotly`, and `leaflet`.
- Interactive visualizations: bar charts, line charts, and choropleth world map to show salary distributions.

## üñºÔ∏è Infographic
The final deliverable is an infographic summarizing:
- Average salaries by country and experience level.
- Trends in Data Science salaries (2020‚Äì2024).
- Distribution of work models and employment types.
